                <h4>Dont be afraid to make mistakes!</h4>
                <p>When programming for the first time, you will not be good at it. In fact you will be bad at it. However, if you are willing to be bad at something in order to get great at something you will survive. </p>
 
                <p>Don't be afraid to fail. Failure is often the building block of success. instead of looking at it as a failure, look at it as feedback or a lesson. Take what you did wrong and adjust it for next time. Learn from your mistakes. </p>
 
                <h4>Nothing great comes from your comfort zone.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, or anything for that matter you will be extrememly uncomfortable. The reason for that is because it is new. Everything you do for the first time will be uncomfortable. </p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of learning and trying new things in life.</p>
                <p> You have to understand that everything GREAT you do in life will be done uncomfortably. Kick the notion that you should be comfortable and you should do things that make you feel good and that are
                    comfortable</p>
